Coldplay [00:13.72] I used to rule the world
Coldplay [00:17.41] Seas would rise when I gave the word
Coldplay [00:20.21] Now in the morning I sleep alone
Coldplay [00:24.22] Sweep the streets I used to own
Coldplay [00:41.61] I used to roll the dice
Coldplay [00:45.11] Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Coldplay [00:48.31] Listen as the crowd would sing
Coldplay [00:52.31] Now the old king is dead Long live the king
Coldplay [00:55.62] One minute I held the key
Coldplay [00:59.11] Next the walls were closed on me
Coldplay [01:02.10] And I discovered that my castles stand
Coldplay [01:06.00] Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
Coldplay [01:09.40] I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Coldplay [01:14.01] Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Coldplay [01:17.22] Be my mirror my sword and shield
Coldplay [01:20.31] My missionaries in a foreign field
Coldplay [01:23.80] For some reason I can't explain
Coldplay [01:27.32] Once You are gone there was never
Coldplay [01:30.42] Never an honest word
Coldplay [01:34.22] But that was when I ruled the world
Coldplay [01:50.70] It was the wicked and wild wind
Coldplay [01:54.51] Blew down the doors to let me in
Coldplay [01:57.61] Shattered windows and the sound of drums
Coldplay [02:01.61] People couldn't believe what I had become
Coldplay [02:05.02] Revolutionaries wait
Coldplay [02:08.71] For my head on a silver plate
Coldplay [02:11.62] Just a puppet on a lonely string
Coldplay [02:16.01] Oh who would ever want to be king
Coldplay [02:19.30] I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Coldplay [02:23.02] Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Coldplay [02:26.40] Be my mirror my sword and shield
Coldplay [02:29.81] My missionaries in a foreign field
Coldplay [02:33.31] For some reason I can't explain
Coldplay [02:36.82] I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Coldplay [02:40.12] Never an honest word
Coldplay [02:43.50] But that was when I ruled the world
Coldplay [03:15.52] I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Coldplay [03:18.71] Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Coldplay [03:22.00] Be my mirror my sword and shield
Coldplay [03:25.52] My missionaries in a foreign field
Coldplay [03:28.92] For some reason I can't explain
Coldplay [03:32.41] I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Coldplay [03:35.71] Never an honest word
Coldplay [03:39.01] But that was when I ruled the world
